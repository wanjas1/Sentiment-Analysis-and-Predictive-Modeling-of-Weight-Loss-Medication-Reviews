39293,Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.""",9,42799,35

I was very nervous about starting Contrave given what I had read about the side effects. I don%u2019t take meds very often, and I didn&#039;t like the idea of going on a recurring and long term pill. That being said, the first week on Contrave has been incredible. I will say I was food obsessed before. Thoughts of food ran through my head throughout the day, and the idea of eating was always there.

I had no idea how much mental energy I had been spending pushing those thoughts aside. Now, with Contrave, my head is clear. I no longer sit at my desk and watch the clock, waiting until it%u2019s a reasonable time to eat, or force myself to push on another hour before ultimately giving in and getting a snack.

When I do eat %u2013 and yes, I still very much enjoy the taste of food %u2013 I don%u2019t feel that same sense of urgency and elation I use to. Those feelings would often trigger binge eating.

It makes me not want to be around other people so I stay in all the time, which leads to extreme lethargy.  I just lay in bed all day and spiral downward until I have no energy to do anything at all.   Fastin gives me the energy psychologically as well as physically to get out of bed and start doing things.  It does cause some side effects, but these are to be expected with something that works so powerfully.  Only this or Zoloft have helped me to lead a productive life.   With doctors for zoloft, I have to make appointments, pay for insurance, a doctor visit,  the prescription, and wait in line at the pharmacy, none of which I can do after I run out of medication.

I was very nervous about starting Contrave given what I had read about the side effects. I don%u2019t take meds very often, and I didn&#039;t like the idea of going on a recurring and long term pill. That being said, the first week on Contrave has been incredible. I will say I was food obsessed before. Thoughts of food ran through my head throughout the day, and the idea of eating was always there.

I had no idea how much mental energy I had been spending pushing those thoughts aside. Now, with Contrave, my head is clear. I no longer sit at my desk and watch the clock, waiting until it%u2019s a reasonable time to eat, or force myself to push on another hour before ultimately giving in and getting a snack.
